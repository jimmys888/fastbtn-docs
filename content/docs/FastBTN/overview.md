## What is FastBTN?

**FastBTN** is a button-based trading Expert Advisor (EA) for **MetaTrader 5**, designed to help traders **open, manage, and close trades quickly and efficiently** directly from the chart.

Instead of placing trades manually through MT5’s default interface, FastBTN provides **on-chart buttons** and automation features that allow you to control trades with just a few clicks, such as:
- Buy / Sell
- Closing positions
- Managing lot size, TP, and SL

FastBTN does **not** trade automatically.  
You remain fully in control of **when** and **how** trades are opened and closed.

FastBTN **only** works for open positions, not for pending orders.

## Who is FastBTN for?

FastBTN is suitable for traders who:

- Prefer **manual or semi-manual trading**
- Want **faster execution** than MT5’s default workflow
- Trade actively and need **one-click actions**

FastBTN is **not** intended to:
- Replace a fully automated trading strategy
- Make trading decisions for you
- Guarantee profits

You decide:
- When to enter
- When to exit
- How much risk to take
  
FastBTN does exactly what you tell it to do — no hidden logic, no automatic entries. It simply makes those actions **faster and easier**.

## Important Disclaimer

**Trading involves risk.**  
FastBTN is a trading tool, not a trading strategy.

You are fully responsible for all trading decisions and outcomes.  
Always test FastBTN on a **demo account** before using it on a live account.
