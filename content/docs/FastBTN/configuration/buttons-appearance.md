## Button Text
Every button in FastBTN has a *Button Text* property than can be changed to suit your needs. You can also use emojis.

Notes on emojis:
- For more compatibility, we recommend using **Segoe UI Emoji** as the *font family*. It is pre-installed with Windows.
- Emojis will be shown in monochrome (black and white).

  **Tip**\
  To show the current pair in the button text, use four dollar signs ($$$$). For example, if on XAU/USD you enter ***Close $$$$ Profit***, it will display as ***Close XAUUSD Profit***.

  This is useful when you save *FastBTN* settings and load them on another pair—it will automatically show that pair's symbol, so you don't have to enter the symbol manually for each pair.

## Button Color
You can also change every button's color to make it easier for you to identify what each button does.

## Button Text Color, Font Family, Font Size

Please note that these **will not have any effect** if in *Genenal Settings* → *Uniformity in All Buttons*, you set:
- ***Use same text color for all buttons*** = `true`
- ***Use same font for all buttons*** = `true`
- ***Use same font size for all buttons*** = `true`

To use different text color, font family and font size for each button, you must set those settings to `false` accordingly.

To use a font family, make sure the font is already installed on your computer.
