## Button Text
You can change the text every button in *FastBTN* to suit your needs. Just change the *Button Text* property on each button.

---

## Button Color
You can also change every button's color to make it easier for you to identify what each button does.

Please note that these **will not have any effect** if in *Genenal Settings* → *Uniformity in All Buttons*, you set:
- ***Use same text color for all buttons*** = `true`
- ***Use same font for all buttons*** = `true`
- ***Use same font size for all buttons*** = `true`

To use different text color, font family and font size for each button, you must set those settings to `false` accordingly.

To use a font family, make sure the font is already installed on your computer.
