In addition to the 6 [close buttons](/docs/fastbtn/configuration/close-buttons), there are 4 additional buttons to close Buy or Sell positions only:
1. Close all **Buy** positions on **current pair**.
2. Close all **Sell** positions on **current pair**.
3. Close all **Buy** positions on **all pairs**.
4. Close all **Sell** positions on **all pairs**.

Each of these buttons can be styled like any other buttons, and can be disabled according to your needs, for example if you only trade in one direction. Disabled button will not be shown on the chart.
