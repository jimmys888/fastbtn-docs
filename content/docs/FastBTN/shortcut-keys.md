FastBTN supports keyboard shortcuts to help you execute actions faster without relying only on mouse clicks. Using shortcuts can significantly improve your workflow, especially during active trading.

However, you should only use shortcut keys **when you're confident with them**.

The risk of using shortcut keys is the same as clicking the wrong button: you press the wrong key. Furthermore, you don't see anything visually when using shortcut keys. You have to memorize the keys. When you're just starting out, pause and think for a moment before you press a key, then press it only after you're confident it's the correct key.

After some time, you will develop *muscle memory* and you'll be less likely to make mistakes.

## Enabling or Disabling Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts can be enabled or disabled through FastBTN input settings.

To adjust shortcut behavior:

1. Press **F7** to open FastBTN properties.
2. Go to the **Inputs** tab.
3. Locate `Enable Shortcut Keys` at the top, under `General Button Settings`. Set it to `true` to enable it, `false` to disable it. Default is `false`.
4. Click **OK** to apply the changes.

If shortcuts are disabled, all actions must be performed using on-chart buttons.

## When to Use Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts are especially useful when:

- You need to act quickly during fast market movements
- You want to reduce mouse usage
- You already know your preferred actions by muscle memory

However, if you are new to FastBTN, it is recommended to first become comfortable using the on-chart buttons before relying on shortcuts.

## Important Notes

- Shortcuts only work when the chart window is active
- Shortcut keys may conflict with MT5 or system shortcuts
- Always try this feature on a demo account first to verify their actions before using it on a live account

If a shortcut does not work as expected, check the FastBTN input settings or your system key assignments.

## Default Shortcuts
