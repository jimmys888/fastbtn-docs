## Overview
FastBTN is often used together with **FastSTAT**, a free companion indicator that provides **real-time statistics** and visual information related to your trades. They can be used independently, but together they provide a more complete trading workflow.

With FastSTAT, you can see useful information directly on your chart, such as *total profit for current pair*, *total profit for all pairs*, *volumes*, *BEP Line*, and more.

While FastBTN focuses on **execution**, FastSTAT is a **visual tool only** that focuses on **information and monitoring**:
- FastSTAT does not place or modify trades
- It does not affect FastBTN’s logic or execution
- Removing FastSTAT will not impact FastBTN’s operation

FastSTAT is designed to be lightweight and informative, keeping your chart clean while providing useful insights.

**FastSTAT is completely free**.
You can use it without purchasing or using FastBTN.

## What FastSTAT Displays

Depending on your configuration, FastSTAT can show:
- Current profit or loss for a pair and all pairs
- Profit in currency or pips
- Current price
- Spread
- Time to bar closure
- Server time
- Volume for a pair and all pairs
- Break even price line

All values update automatically as market prices change.

## Who Should Use FastSTAT?

FastSTAT is useful for traders who:

- Want quick visibility of their trading performance
- Manage multiple positions on the same symbol
- Prefer visual information over checking the Terminal window
- Use FastBTN and want a cleaner workflow

FastSTAT can be used **with or without FastBTN**, but it is most effective when used together.

## Using FastSTAT with FastBTN

FastSTAT is designed to complement FastBTN:
- **FastBTN** handles trade execution and management
- **FastSTAT** provides visual feedback and statistics

While FastSTAT can be used on its own, it is most useful when used together with FastBTN, especially when managing multiple positions on the same symbol.
